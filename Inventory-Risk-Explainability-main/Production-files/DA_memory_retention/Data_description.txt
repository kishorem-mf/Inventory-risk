Terminologies Details -
1. Terms-
- Key Figure: A named metric (for example, “Consensus Demand”, “Stock on Hand”, or “Capacity Utilization”) that tells you which supply‑chain KPI is being measured.
- Bucketed Weeks (WXX YYYY): Columns like “W22 2025” represent the value of a Key Figure in that calendar week.
- Projected Stock vs. Inventory Target vs. Safety Stock:Inventory Target is the desired stock level at a location. Safety Stock is the buffer to cover demand/supply variability.Projected Stock forecasts future on‑hand levels after planned receipts and issues.
- Dependent Demand: Demand for a component or raw material that is directly derived from higher‑level production plans (i.e. the bill‑of‑materials requirements).
- Production Freeze Horizon: A number of days before which planners are not allowed to adjust manufacturing orders, ensuring stability in the shop‑floor schedule. First 3 weeks of the data is considered frozen weeks
- Transport Lot Size & Lead Time: The minimum batch you must ship (lot size) and how many weeks it takes (lead time) to move from one location to another.

2. Understock/Overstock 
- Plant, Regional Distribution Center (RDC) and Distribution Center (DC) are the location where product is to be checked for understock and overstock inventory.
- More than 3 consecutive weeks of understock or overstock is considered as an instance of understock or overstock product at any given location.
- Overstock week is when Projected stock for that week is greater than Safety Stock and Understock is when Projected stock for that week is greater than Safety Stock.

Note:
SFG refers to intermediate products created from raw materials (RM).
The production flow typically follows this sequence: RM → SFG → FG

The supply chain flow is as follows
Product is produced as Plant. From plant it goes to RDC , then to DC and then finally reaches to customer
There is lead time associated with transportation of product from one location to another.
