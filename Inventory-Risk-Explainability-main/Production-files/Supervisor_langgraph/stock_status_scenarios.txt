# Master Whitepaper: Inventory Imbalance Scenarios in Supply Chain  

## Context  
Inventory imbalances in supply chains can manifest as **understock (shortages)** or **overstock (excess inventory)**.  
- **Understock** → Projected stock falls below safety stock or negative, leading to potential stockouts and service-level issues.  
- **Overstock** → Projected stock consistently above inventory targets, causing high carrying costs, working capital lock-in, and obsolescence risk.  

Both conditions can arise from **supply, demand, logistics, production, or planning inaccuracies**.  
This whitepaper provides a comprehensive catalog of scenarios with tags to help LLMs classify and explain reasons.

## Key Observations  
- **Understock drivers:** Demand spikes, supply/transport delays, production bottlenecks, lag week mismatches, capacity shortages.  
- **Overstock drivers:** Over-ordering, early/duplicate receipts, large lot sizes, forecast drops, long lead times with buffers, lag week overforecasting.  
- **Lag Week Impact:** Previous plan mismatches (forecast changes, PO/production delays, over/under forecasting) play a significant role in both understock and overstock.
