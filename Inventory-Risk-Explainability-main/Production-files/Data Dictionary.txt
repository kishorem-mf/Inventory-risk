You are provided supply‑chain planning database with master tables (products, locations, resources, transport rules) and a suite of weekly‑bucket fact tables capturing demand, supply, inventory, capacity, and financial performance.
This data model captures a full end‑to‑end view of a manufacturing and distribution network. Products flow from vendors through plants and distribution centers to customers. Production processes and resource constraints are defined, and shipments follow defined transport rules. 
Everything is tracked on a weekly “bucket” basis (e.g. W22 2025). Connect these tables to generate insights.

Terminologies Details -
1. Terms-
- Key Figure: A named metric (for example, “Consensus Demand”, “Stock on Hand”, or “Capacity Utilization”) that tells you which supply‑chain KPI is being measured.
- Bucketed Weeks (WXX YYYY): Columns like “W22 2025” represent the value of a Key Figure in that calendar week.
- Projected Stock vs. Inventory Target vs. Safety Stock:Inventory Target is the desired stock level at a location. Safety Stock is the buffer to cover demand/supply variability.Projected Stock forecasts future on‑hand levels after planned receipts and issues.
- Dependent Demand: Demand for a component or raw material that is directly derived from higher‑level production plans (i.e. the bill‑of‑materials requirements).
- Production Freeze Horizon: A number of days before which planners are not allowed to adjust manufacturing orders, ensuring stability in the shop‑floor schedule. First 3 weeks of the data is considered frozen weeks
- Transport Lot Size & Lead Time: The minimum batch you must ship (lot size) and how many weeks it takes (lead time) to move from one location to another.

2. Understock/Overstock 
- Plant, Regional Distribution Center (RDC) and Distribution Center (DC) are the location where product is to be checked for understock and overstock inventory.
- More than 3 consecutive weeks of understock or overstock is considered as an instance of understock or overstock product at any given location.
- Overstock week is when Projected stock for that week is greater than Safety Stock and Understock is when Projected stock for that week is greater than Safety Stock.

3. *Understock/Overstock Explainability


4. Table Links
All of these tables link primarily by the Product ID and Location ID keys (and, where relevant, Resource ID or Source ID). 
By joining on those identifiers plus the weekly “bucket” columns, you can generate end‑to‑end extraction queries.
- Product ↔ Location Product ↔ Location Source
(Defines which product at which site and how it moves through the network.)
- Production & Resources
Location Product ↔ Production Source Header ↔ Location Resource
(Ties products at a plant to specific production processes and the resources that execute them.)
-Demand Fulfillment, Review DC, Review Plant, Review Vendors, Review Capacity, Review Component, Profit Margin
each reference Product ID and one or more location or customer keys to pull in weekly values
- Refer Production Source Item table to see which raw material are consumed to create a finished good.
