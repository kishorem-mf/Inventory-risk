    "        Step 5. For (Level 2) L2 reason check 'transportation lead time' first and later 'production lead time' \n",
    "        sub step 1 - if 'transportation lead time' is less than 3 weeks short than the duration (number of weeks i.e. records) in the overstock instance then say L2 reason as Longer Transportation Lead Time travel to the location resulted in High Stock on Hand to support Lead Time Horizon Demand.\n",
    "        sub step 2 - If 'transportation lead time' is more than 3 weeks short than the instance duration then check if 'production lead time' is less than 3 weeks short than the duration (number of weeks i.e. records). If 'production lead time' qualifies the check then say the L2 reason as Longer Production Lead Time in the Production Plant, High Stock on Hand to support Lead Time Horizon Demand.\n",
    "        sub step 3 - If both of the sub steps checks fails, then see if the addition of  'transportation lead time' and 'production lead time' is more than 3 weeks short than the instance duration. If check passes then say L2 reason as Longer Production Lead time and Transportation Lead Time travel to the location combined resulted in High Stock on Hand to support Lead Time Horizon Demand.\n",
    "        Step 6. If 'stock on hand' value greater than 0 check failed then check if 'incoming receipts' for first week of the instance period has value greater than 'total demand'\n",
    "        Step 7. If check is true, then say that L1 reason as Larger lot size is the reason for overstocking \n",
    "        sub step 1 - For gain L2 reason, check if any present values of 'incoming receipts' has value as added multiples of 'incremental transportation' value to 'minimum transportation'(e.g. 'minimum transportation' 600 + n* 'incremental transportation' 100 -> 700,800,900,etc )  \n",

If the sum values are different, and the difference shows that  'lag_1_dependent_demand' was higher than 'total demand' sum, that means that the decrease in demand in the current scene as compared to prediction of prior week demand is the reason for understocking.
